## Features

- **Minimalistic output**: aiming to adhere to the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), footy's output can easily be piped to other tools
- **Portable**: minimal [dependencies](#dependencies)

## Install

Since footy uses the data provided by [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/), an api-key is required.
You can register for one [here](https://www.football-data.org/client/register) for free.

Once installed, set the api-key by running `footy -k <api-key>` or manually create the file `$HOME/.config/footy/api-key.txt` containing only the api-key.  

### Build from source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fritzrehde/footy.git
cd footy
sudo make install
```

**Note:** The makefile defaults to some default paths for installed files. Adjust to your system:

- `INSTALL_DIR`: PATH for executables (default /usr/local/bin)

```shell
make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/bin
```

### Linux
AUR: *to be added*

### MacOS
Homebrew: *to be added*


## Usage
```text
Usage: footy [-s <league> | -l | -t <league> | -k <api-key> | -h]
-s <league>         Prints standings in a league (use league's code or id).
-l                  Prints all supported leagues.
-t <league>         Prints all teams in a league (use league's code or id).
-k <api-key>        Saves the api-key to $HOME/.config/footy/api-key.txt
-h                  Prints this user documentation.
```

### Supported leagues and teams
Use the `-l` option to get an overview of all supported leagues (I recommend piping the output into a [pager](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html)), then use `-t <league>` with either a league's *Code* or *Id* as the argument to see all teams in that league (e.g. `footy -t BL1` and `footy -t 2002` both work).

Some leagues and teams do not have a *Code*, so you will have to use the *Id* there.

**Note**: Access to some of the smaller leagues/teams is paid ([pricing](https://www.football-data.org/coverage)). Therefore, the *Price* column shows which leagues are free.
